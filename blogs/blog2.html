                Games are something that has fascinated me every time I played it. The first game that I ever played was "Feeding Frenzy",  a game made by PopCap on the year 2004. It features a fish as the main player, and all you have to do is eat other fishes to get better scores. Eventually, I moved on to other games like Spider Man, Hitman and later had an interest in fps games like Counter Strike, Apex Legends, Rainbow 6, Valorant and the like.

                At one point, I started to wonder how games are being made, so I decided to search about game engines. Upon learning how they are being made in different styles and mechanics, my interest got to a peak making me explore more games having different genres. For me though, gaming does not only mean to play, but to also understand how the game works (AI, objects, NPCs). 
            </p> 
            <p>In my opinion, if you truly want to enjoy playing games and get immersed, understanding game mechanics is vital, only then will you be able to truly appreciate the developers and their hardwork ðŸ™‚ And yeah, if you feel you need more games to play, do feel free to ask me games which you haven't played yet or better yet, suggest me some! ðŸ˜„
