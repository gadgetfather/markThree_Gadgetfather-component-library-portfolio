              The world runs on truth and science is the engine to discover that truth. Since childhood, I was always into technology but never realized that science was the backbone of it. When I came to know that, I started exploring more but I was more into machines rather than physics and chemistry type of science.

             Initially, it was just smartphones and computers but as I grew up more clarity came. Till 10th standard, it was just basic science how do chemicals mix up and stuff like that plus basic biology (which I am not a very big fan of). In college, I chose the science stream because it was exhilarating for me. There I had an electronics subject which led me to deeper studies of electronic hardware and how machines just communicate using ones and zeros. It was very interesting. I learned that we can even the nature of the current or if it is present or not. At the end of my college, I found about programming.I knew about programming for a long time it's just that I didn't know what exactly it was.

              So during the early days of my engineering, we had this C programming course. It was interesting but the way they taught us, took us farther from the language than bringing us closer. Moving ahead somehow I found out about "NeoGcamp" and everything changed from that point. I made 15 projects on my own. That's how my interest in coding reignited!
